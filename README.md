### What I learned

I learned how to build an accordion. It's one of the things I wanted to make as it's a common feature on the FAQs section of a website. I found that using ```<details>``` and ```<summary>``` are best for this.

```
html
<h1>FAQ</h1>
<details>
  <summary>How many team members can I invite?</summary>
    <p>You can invite up to 2 additional users on the Free plan. There is no limit on 
    team members for the Premium plan.</p>
</details>
```

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - This helped me with all my CSS needs. I really liked how it examples CSS concepts in a clear and visual way and will use it going forward.
